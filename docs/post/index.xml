      <title>Number representation in digital electronics -- Part 1 (Numerical bases)</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;In this series of posts, we will look at the different ways that numbers are stored and processed in computers and other electronic devices, as well as some details of the specific data formats used to represent numeric values in computer memory. An important part of this is the binary numeral system, since we usually think of digital data as being in binary form. The binary and decimal systems both use a position-value notation, and this first post will focus on some of the common characteristics of this type of system, and how this allows numbers to be expressed in different bases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-role-of-numerals&#34;&gt;The role of numerals&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although we sometimes use the two terms interchangeably, numbers and numerals are different things. A &lt;em&gt;numeral&lt;/em&gt; is a symbolic representation of a number.  Numbers are abstract concepts, and numerals are the names and symbols that denote them. &lt;em&gt;Numeral systems&lt;/em&gt; (also called number systems) are formal methods and notation for expressing numbers in concrete form &amp;mdash; that is, as numerals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://hangar.farmradio.fm/images/2017/01/heh.png&#34; alt=&#34;Heh&#34; style=&#34;width:260px;&#34;&gt;&lt;center style=&#34;margin-top:-20px;&#34;&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;i&gt;In the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic numeral system, the god &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heh_(god)&#34;&gt;Heh&lt;/a&gt; symbolized one million.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;positional-numeral-systems&#34;&gt;Positional numeral systems&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In our ordinary decimal system, known as the &lt;em&gt;Hindu-Arabic&lt;/em&gt; notation, we write numbers as sequences, or strings, of &lt;em&gt;digits&lt;/em&gt; &amp;mdash; a digit being one of the symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9. The decimal numbers are said to have a numerical base (or &lt;em&gt;radix&lt;/em&gt;) ten. We can think of the base as the size of the alphabet from where we choose these individual digits. By constructing strings of length $s$ using characters from this alphabet, we are then able to represent all integers in the interval $[0 .. 10^s-1]$. Conversely, any natural number can be decomposed into a &lt;a href=&#34;http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LinearCombination.html&#34;&gt;linear combination&lt;/a&gt; of integral powers of ten, multiplied by coefficients chosen in the range from zero to nine. For example, we can express the number 51,304 as the sum&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
5 \cdot 10^4 + 1 \cdot 10^3 + 3 \cdot 10^2 + 0 \cdot 10^1 + 4 \cdot 10^0 = 51 304
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Numeral systems of this kind are called &lt;em&gt;positional&lt;/em&gt;. Each digit is assigned a weight, based on its position in the sequence. Another property, shared by all the numeral systems we will consider here, is that they have a &lt;em&gt;uniform&lt;/em&gt; base, i.e., the same base is used in all positions of the string. Let $d_q \dots d_2 d_1 d_0$ denote an arbitrary natural number $n$. In other words, $d_i$ is the digit at position $i$ in the decimal string representation of $n$. Then&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
n = d_q 10^q + \cdots + d_2 10^2 + d_1 10^1 + d_0.
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More generally, for any radix $b$ we can find coefficients $a_0, a_1, \dots, a_q$, such that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
n = a_q b^q + \cdots + a_2 b^2 + a_1 b^1 + a_0 \text{ where } 0 \le a_i &amp;lt; b \text{ for all $ i $, and $ a_q \ne 0 $}.
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The length of this sequence is $q + 1$, for some integer $q \ge 0$.  To express $q$ in terms of $n$, first consider the real number $x$ such that $b^x = n.$ Then $x = \log_b n,$ and $q$ is the largest integer less than or equal to $x$. This mapping is known as the &lt;em&gt;floor&lt;/em&gt; function and we write $q = \lfloor\log_b n\rfloor$. Then, if&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;$$
n = \!\!\! \sum_{i=0}^{\lfloor\log_b n\rfloor} \!\!\! a_i b^i \; (0 \le a_i &amp;lt; b)
$$&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;there is exactly one way in which we can choose these coefficients.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Uliza:Connecting broadcasters and farmers for better radio</title>
      <link>http://hangar.farmradio.fm/post/uliza-connecting-broadcasters-and-farmers/</link>

 &lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At Farm Radio International we work to share knowledge with small-scale African farmers and make sure their voices are heard. Radio is a really effective way to reach a large audience, but it is essentially a one-way communications tool. So how do make sure that we’re helping radio stations to engage with listeners in an actual conversation?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Radio and mobile phones are the most powerful communications tools in Africa. And they are stronger together than they are alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining radio with other technologies is all in a day’s work at The Hangar, our radio and ICT innovation lab in Arusha, Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in partnership with our friends at VOTO Mobile with support from the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the team at The Hangar developed a web-based application for gathering and analyzing feedback and questions from audience members via mobile phones. It’s called Uliza, Swahili for “to ask.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining radio with other technologies is all in a day’s work at The Hangar, our radio and ICT innovation lab in Arusha, Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in partnership with our friends at VOTO Mobile with support from the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the team at The Hangar developed a web-based application for gathering and analyzing feedback and questions from audience members via mobile phones. It’s called Uliza, Swahili for “to ask.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uliza was designed to encourage participatory radio by making it easier for listeners to engage with radio stations and for radio stations to visualize and interpret audience feedback. It utilizes VOTO Mobile’s interactive voice response (IVR) system and the ubiquity of basic mobile phones to enable a two-way conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IVR technology connects people with computer programs through voice commands and keypad inputs. And it’s a very powerful way to connect small-scale farmers with the radio stations that serve them, and to help those stations serve them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With Uliza, farmers can access important messages and alerts, vote on poll questions, leave messages, and request the delivery of specific information. For example, in our orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) project, Uliza connected farmers looking to source OFSP vines with local vine suppliers. If a listener responded “no” when asked if they knew where to access vines, the system would be prompted to provide the location of local OFSP vine sellers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Uliza presents data from listeners visually, making it easy for broadcasters to interpret the information and use it during broadcasts. They can air comments left in voice messages, share listeners’ questions with on-the-air experts, integrate audience feedback into on-air discussions, and get feedback on radio programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this way, Uliza is supporting a continuous feedback loop that makes farm radio better for its listeners. And that’s what it’s all about.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mapping our impact</title>
      <link>http://hangar.farmradio.fm/post/mapping-our-impact/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Feb 2016 14:58:37 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://hangar.farmradio.fm/post/mapping-our-impact/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With upwards of 35 weekly broadcasts across sub-Saharan Africa, estimating audiences is a challenging but essential job for Farm Radio International. Radio goes a long way but it does not go everywhere. Hills and valleys play a huge role in determining whether or not a given community can listen. If we are to measure the impact of broadcasts in a meaningful way, it is important to know both where the signal goes and where it does not go.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;http://hangar.farmradio.fm/images/2016/Feb/Radio_5_Arusha_web.png&#34; alt=&#34;Radio 5 coverage map&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, accurate radio coverage maps for many of our partner stations do not exist. So we adapted existing, open-source software used by radio equipment contractors to meet the needs of radio broadcasters in Africa. The software works in conjunction with the detailed terrain maps produced by Google Earth and others to give an accurate signal map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By combining the coverage pattern with a population density database, it is possible to estimate the potential listening audience for any radio station. Radio-dark zones are also obvious, which helps us plan household survey and evaluation work. Comparing the knowledge and behaviour of farmers with access to the radio program to those who cannot access the broadcast allows us to isolate the impact of a particular radio program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, our partner radio stations now have a much better idea of their audience reach. That can help with setting advertising and sponsorship rates — adding to financial sustainability for the stations and helping them to better serve their audiences.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Innovations: Beeping for vital information</title>
      <link>http://hangar.farmradio.fm/post/beep-for-information/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Feb 2016 15:26:39 +0300</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://hangar.farmradio.fm/post/beep-for-information/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Radio is a fantastic tool for reaching millions of listeners with life-changing information. But the cell phone revolution is making this communication tool even more powerful. A cell phone allows listeners to call the radio station and contribute to a program.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;‘Beeping’ also allows callers to contribute and receive information in new ways. ‘Beeping’ has become a new buzzword at The Hangar, our Radio and Innovation Lab located in Arusha, Tanzania.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beep2vote allows listeners to vote in a poll question by simply leaving a missed call ‘beep’ to a designated number. Generally a separate number is designated to each option in the poll question, so the missed calls are simply tallied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Listening Post builds on this by instead using an interactive voice response system to call the farmer and conduct a poll using the keypad. This means farmers can also add their voice to open-ended questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Leaving a missed call ‘beep’ is free for the caller, which is important because while cell phones are fairly common across Africa, air time can be expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some other ways we are using ‘beeping:’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beep4weather&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weather information is vital for farmers. This is more than just the temperature; information on when major rainfall, a heat wave or drought it expected helps farmers make decisions about planting and harvesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beep4weather provides this information on-demand, coupled with agricultural tips. Farmers ‘beep’ the number, and an interactive voice response system returns the call, providing a recent weather report and related agricultural tips. Local broadcasters are engaged to gather this information, record it and promote the system on their radio show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beep2vox&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In radio, “vox” is a term for voice (from the Latin). Beep2vox is our system for putting more voices on air, without cost to the caller.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sharing farmers voices over the airwaves is an important component for participatory radio. Our beep2vox system allows farmers to call the radio station and share their voice — for free. After leaving a free missed call beep, the farmer is called back and asked to share their opinion on the question of the week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This system is being used in our Her Voice on Air project in four countries: Ethiopia, Malawi, Tanzania and Uganda. Beep2vox is getting more women’s voices on air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beep4tips&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Farmers have hectic schedules that don’t always leave time to tune in to agricultural programs. Beep4tips allows farmers to catch up on the important information they may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters record the highlights from their show to share with listeners. Callers ‘beep’ the number shared by the radio station, and an interactive voice response system returns the call to play this summary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beep4tips is also useful for farmers who need a reminder of the show’s advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beep4inputs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, the hardest part of trying to grow a new crop is finding the materials. Beep4inputs is designed to connect farmers with local suppliers of agricultural inputs, such as seeds, vines and even specially-designed storage bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After leaving a missed call ‘beep’ to a designated phone number, farmers will receive a call back. A recorded message provides them with access to a directory of suppliers based on their location – all of this at no cost to the farmer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bart Sullivan, ‘Captain’ of The Hangar, describes the service as a ‘Yellow Pages’ for agricultural inputs, linking supply and demand. It has even helped farmers start their own agribusiness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Many distributors have been quite successful from being referred to other farmers through the service, so much so that farmers see it as a great business opportunity. A year later they come back and say ‘We were beginners last year, but now we’re selling vines. Can you put our names on the list?’ So it becomes a circle.”&lt;/p&gt;
