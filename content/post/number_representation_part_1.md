In this series of posts, we will look at the different ways that numbers are stored and processed in computers and other electronic devices, as well as some details of the specific data formats used to represent numeric values in computer memory. An important part of this is the binary numeral system, since we usually think of digital data as being in binary form. The binary and decimal systems both use a position-value notation, and this first post will focus on some of the common characteristics of this type of system, and how they allow numbers to be expressed in different bases.

### The role of numerals

Although we sometimes use the two terms interchangeably, numbers and numerals are different things. A *numeral* is a symbolic representation of a number.  Numbers are abstract concepts, and numerals are the names and symbols that denote them. *Numeral systems* (also called number systems) are formal methods and notation for expressing numbers in concrete form &mdash; that is, as numerals.
